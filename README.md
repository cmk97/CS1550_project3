# Virtual Memory Simulator

This is a project that was created Pitt's CS1550. The program reads in a sample memory reference trace generated by two processes and then simulates the second chance page replacement algorithm. As it runs, it collects statistics on memory accesses, page faults, and writes to disk. 

A sample trace file is included in this repo. You can run the program like this:

```
./vmsim â€“n <numframes> -p <pagesize in KB> -s <memory split> <tracefile>
```

This an an example of a sample output:

```
Algorithm: Second Chance
Number of frames: 10
Page size: 8 KB
Total memory accesses: 1270
Total page faults: 68
Total writes to disk: 31
```
